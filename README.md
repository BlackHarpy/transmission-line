# Transmission Line

A game for the Global Game Jam 2018 made with Phaser

## Description

The game consists or changing letters going through a belt to form the output word. There are various controls for the characters: Swap two letter with one another, change case, go to next letter or last letter. The controls are placed on top of the belts and when a block with a letter goes through it, makes the transformation.

Even though is a game made for web, it counts with an Electron configuration to make an executable build.
